Introducing Radicle
===================

    because ‚Äôtis the Origin of the Root‚Ä¶ The Radicle is likewise called the seminal Root.

    -- Vallemont, Curiosities of nature and art in husbandry and gardening (1707)

Radicle is a peer-to-peer stack for creating open source software together. A collaboration environment that‚Äôs designed to be:

- **Offline first** : all data, including issues, comments and other social artifacts is yours & lives on your machine.
- **Peer-to-peer** : with no central server or intermediary in control.
- **Cryptographically secure** : user data that is tamper-proof & unforgeable, using public key cryptography.
- **Programmable** : developers can program the way in which they collaborate.
- **Interoperable & open** : reflecting the values of the open source community.


Radicle integrates with distributed version control systems like git and includes a high-level language with reprogrammable semantics, P2P networking for sharing application state, and flexible command line tools. Inspired by P2P protocols like `Secure Scuttlebutt <https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/>`_, radicle connects distributed version control with peer-to-peer networking and extends the idea of replicated logs to fully re-programmable state machines we call *chains*.

Today we‚Äôre releasing a core component of the radicle stack, an implementation of the radicle language, along with a `paper <https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmadmGA6mBWZ93Wv4XKuCu9wdPf7Da8pjH3Corzpe9VGZg>`_ describing its formal semantics.

The Radicle stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The radicle language is the basis for a stack of components that together compose a fully featured collaborative programming environment.

- **Radicle utilities** : Library of collaboration primitives, including projects, issues, and diff proposals.
- **Radicle language** : Specialized Lisp dialect for specifying, interpreting, and dynamically modifying the semantics of arbitrary state machines.
- **Radicle daemon** : Peer-to-peer gossip and state replication layer for publishing and subscribing to updates from other collaborators over IPFS.


In the coming months we‚Äôll be sharing more details about these components and making an initial release available for developers, along with tutorials on how to get started.

The Radicle language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Radicle is a universal re-programmable state machine. More precisely, it‚Äôs a domain specific language for creating replicated state machines that can dynamically modify their semantics.

Not only can radicle programs evolve as they advance, this sequential evaluation produces a chain of deterministic state transitions. Chains can represent simple issue logs or more complex structures such as full review flows or testing suites. Because radicle chains store histories of verifiable instructions, they can also be safely replicated across machines. The result is an interactive paradigm, where developers can write collaborative programs that describe their working process as it unfolds.

The radicle language features a number of design choices intended specifically for the above use-case:

-  High-level, Lisp dialect in the flavor of `Black <http://pllab.is.ocha.ac.jp/%7Easai/Black/>`_.
-  Ability to redefine the ``eval`` function, changing the semantics of the language.
-  Lexically scoped with a hyperstatic global environment, i.e. free variable resolution takes place at definition-site rather than call-site.
-  First-class functions for side-effect free computation on chain.
-  Immutable by default.
-  Deterministic effects system for managing state.
-  Syntax closely resembling Clojure.

For a more in-depth overview of the radicle language, refer to our `paper <https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmadmGA6mBWZ93Wv4XKuCu9wdPf7Da8pjH3Corzpe9VGZg>`_.

New ways to collaborate on code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Radicle makes collaboration a primitive ‚Äì starting with git and building up an entirely peer-to-peer developer experience that encourages experimentation around how we write software together. In other words, radicle lets developers program the process of writing code, shaping their workflow around a specific project or context.

Like many P2P systems, radicle uses an offline-first model. Issues, comments, and other social artifacts are stored locally as a log of events and synced automatically with your collaborators. While git repositories are already portable, social artifacts are not - radicle aims to change this. Radicle also allows you to define entirely new message types: projects, feature requests, releases, etc., each with their own event streams, metadata, and access control policies. All of this information is completely portable and self-amending in situ.

Making any kind of semantic modification to a decentralized data structure is typically difficult to coordinate and prone to forks, but radicle‚Äôs programmable evaluator makes this process straightforward, safe, and immediate. Additionally, built-in aggregate signatures allow for the definition of custom security models to read or modify each chain, even to revise an access control policy.

Finally, radicle comes with sensible defaults, ensuring you can be productive right away, while also giving programmers a flexible system for rolling their own software collaboration workflow. Inspired in many ways by `Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_, radicle is designed as an extensible system, where developers can share their programs with one another and extend their revision control environment however they like.

We‚Äôre very excited to `open source <https://github.com/oscoin/radicle>`_ the radicle language and soon the full radicle stack.
