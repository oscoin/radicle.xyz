============
Get involved
============


For general inquiries, chatter, or questions, the easiest ways to get in touch
is on the #radicle IRC channel on Freenode, or via our dev-mailing list.

As of the alpha release, we’re using Radicle for managing our issues. If you
want to track or submit issues, you can checkout the project on Radicle with
the following command:

``rad project checkout <PROJECT_ID>``

For making code contributions to Radicle we still accept PR’s through our
github_, since the rad patch app only works with single commit changes.

Lastly, the core Radicle team does weekly updates on `Secure Scuttlebutt`_, which
you can see by following the #radicle-weekly-updates channel. If you’re not a
scuttlebutt user already, pop over to IRC and we can give you an invite to our
own Scuttlebutt pub :)

Contributions to the Radicle project and interactions with the community should adhere to our `code of conduct <https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/tree/master/code-of-conduct.md>`_.
