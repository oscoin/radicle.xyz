============
Get involved
============


For general inquiries, chatter, or questions, the easiest ways to get in touch
is on the #radicle IRC channel on Freenode, or via our dev-mailing list.

While Radicle is alpha software we still use GitHub_ for development (though we'll 
transition to dogfooding Radicle soon). Issues and PRs welcome!

Lastly, the core Radicle team does weekly updates on `Secure Scuttlebutt`_, which
you can see by following the #radicle-weekly-updates channel. If youâ€™re not a
scuttlebutt user already, pop over to IRC and we can give you an invite to our
own Scuttlebutt pub :)

Also note, all contributions to the Radicle project and interactions with the community should 
adhere to our `code of conduct <https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/tree/master/code-of-conduct.md>`_.
