============
Get involved
============


For general inquiries, chatter, or questions, the easiest ways to get in touch
is on the #radicle IRC channel on Freenode, or via our `dev mailing list`_.

As of the alpha release, we’re using Radicle for managing our issues. If you
want to track or submit issues, you can checkout the project on Radicle with
the following command:

``rad project checkout 12D3KooWPS3UXcvSZSXfi7P4J9Ut8MMVNvN63HHiCSP8rxj3RmtC``

For making code contributions to Radicle we still accept PR’s through our
github_, since the rad patch app only works with single commit changes.

Lastly, the core Radicle team does weekly updates on `Secure Scuttlebutt`_, which
you can see by following the #radicle-weekly-updates channel. If you’re not a
scuttlebutt user already, pop over to IRC and we can give you an invite to our
own Scuttlebutt pub :)

Contributions to the Radicle project and interactions with the community should adhere to our `code of conduct <https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/tree/master/code-of-conduct.md>`_.
