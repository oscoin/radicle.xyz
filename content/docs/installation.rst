Installation & Setup
====================

**Disclaimer**: *Radicle is alpha technology and in heavy development. All your data may be lost. We do not guarantee backwards compatibility between releases. Itâ€™s important to remember that this is experimental software and should be treated as such.*

*This release is aimed for developers and early-adopters who want to get a glimpse into what we are building and help shape the product through feedback or contributions to the Radicle project.*

OS X
====


.. code-block::

   brew tap oscoin/radicle
   brew install radicle-alpha


To run the ``rad`` commands, you must have both a Radicle daemon, and Radicle IPFS daemon running.
For OS X users these can be accessed using `brew services <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services>`_
with the following commands:

.. code-block::

   brew services start radicle-alpha-ipfs
   brew services start radicle-alpha

Finally, interacting with the Radicle apps requires that you have a set of Radicle keys. You
can initialize your keys with the ``rad key create`` command.


Debian/Ubuntu
=============

For Debian-based systems we provide packages.

.. code-block::

    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/static.radicle.xyz/releases/radicle_2019.03.05_amd64.deb
    apt install ./radicle_2019.03.05_amd64.deb

The package includes systemd service files for the Radicle daemon. To
start the deamon run

.. code-block::

    systemctl --user start radicle-daemon

This will also start the ``radicle-ipfs`` service. You can check the
status of a service with ``systemctl --user status <service>``.

Finally, interacting with the Radicle apps requires that you have a set of Radicle keys. You
can initialize your keys with the ``rad key create`` command.

Install From Source
===================

Radicle requires `ipfs`_ and `git-remote-ipfs`_ to run properly. When
installing Radicle from source, make sure you have both of these installed first.

To build Radicle from source you need to install `stack`_.

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/oscoin/radicle.git
   cd radicle

   stack install

Note that `stack` might take as much as 4GB of memory to build Radicle.

Manually running background processes
=====================================

Radicle requires 2 background processes to be running: radicle-daemon and radicle-ipfs-daemon.

If you have installed Radicle via the brew / debian packages, the necessary background processes
should be already available as systemd or brew services respectively (see above).

To run these manually, you can use the following ``rad`` commands:

.. code-block::

   rad daemon-ipfs
   rad daemon-radicle

Finally, interacting with the Radicle apps requires that you have a set of Radicle keys. You
can initialize your keys with the ``rad key create`` command.
