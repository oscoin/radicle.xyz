============================
Tutorial Part 1: Contributor
============================

*Once you've finished installing Radicle you're ready to try the Radicle tutorial.*

*In the Radicle tutorial you'll learn to use some of the basic collaboration tools.*

*First you'll contribute changes to a Radicle project started by someone else. In this section you'll learn the three commands: rad project, rad issues, and rad diff.*

*Then, in part 2, you'll see the other side by walking through the maintainer workflow.*

üåø

Welcome to the Radicle Garden, a new-found island located somewhere off the ASCII shores of `tilde.town <http://tilde.town/~troido/cadastre/town.html>`_. Today we're going to learn how to use the Radicle collaboration apps by adding a plot of our own to the `Radicle Garden <../garden>`_ map, then we'll walk through how the Radicle Garden project was created and steps for managing contributions as a maintainer.

Make sure you've got `Radicle installed <#installation>`_ and let's dig in.

Contribute to the Radicle Garden
================================

The Radicle Garden is a project created using Radicle, with a rendered output hosted found at https://radicle.xyz/garden. A Radicle project contains a git repository as well as the all the issues and proposals associated with that repo.

Before we start contributing, we'll need to download a copy to our computer by checking out the project. To do that we need the project-id: ``12D3KooWSeVNi5qTpDULRMR8UQhhQZfk4taUGRaLoLF7BgAAsUQW``, and then we'll run:

::

  $ rad project checkout 12D3KooWSeVNi5qTpDULRMR8UQhhQZfk4taUGRaLoLF7BgAAsUQW
    Cloning into ./acme/
    remote: Enumerating objects: 70, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (70/70), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (40/40), done.
    remote: Total 1472 (delta 30), reused 60 (delta 22), pack-reused 1402
    Receiving objects: 100% (1472/1472), 4.71 MiB | 1.59 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (546/546), done.
    adding "origin" remote: ipfs://QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG

  Created ./adcme/.rad-config
  To list the project's issues, run:
    rad issue list

In the output shown above we can see that ``rad project`` uses git behind the scenes to clone the project from a remote repo hosted on IPFS into a new folder named after the project-id.

Let's learn a little more about this project by moving into the newly created directory with ``$ cd radicle-garden`` and then listing what's in the folder.

::

  $ ls -a
  .  ..  .git  garden1.txt  garden2.txt


As we can see, the Radicle project folder has a .git directly inside, like any other git repo.

Now let's take a look at what's in these garden text files:

::

  $ cat garden1.txt

                      
         %            
          \_          
          | %         
  ..-`-...l..-..~-`.,.
  ....................
  ....................
  .................... 

Oh, very pretty.

::

  $ cat garden2.txt

               üåû
     ‚òÅ

What beautiful gardens! Each garden file contains an ASCII image. These images are combined to create the community garden page located at https://radicle.xyz/garden.

Like our git repo, Radicle stores issue and proposal chains locally and distributes them over the IPFS network. To look at a list of issues we'll run ``$ rad issue list`` while inside the git repo.

::

  $ rad issue list
  state    issue #   title                        author        updated         
  open     1         Diff proposal not accepted   juliendonck   2019-01-25 13:27

There's only one issue for this project at the moment. Let's take a closer look with ``$ rad issue show 1``.

::

  $ rad issue show 1
  Issue:  #1 Diff proposal not accepted
  Author: juliendonck
  Date:   Fri Nov 16 17:51:36 2018 +0100
  ---
  Description:
    I made a proposal to add my garden to the map, but when I run `rad diff list` the state is listed as rejected.

  ---
  Comments:
    <TODO> It looks like your garden doesn't have the correct dimensions. All gardens should be 20 characters wide and 8 lines high.

If we wanted to add another comment we could run ``$ rad issue comment <issue-number> <body>`` which would open the default editor, set with the $EDITOR environment variable.

Creating an issue works just like adding a git commit message‚Äîadd text at the top and save the file to create the comment.

Now let's make our own garden by creating a new text file, ``$ touch mygarden.txt`` and open the file with your favorite editor.

As mentioned in the issue above, the text should fit in a box of 20 characters wide and 8 lines high.

Once we've planted a few vegatables and feel happy with our garden, we'll save the file and commit it to the repo using git.

::

  $ git status --short
  A messages/yyyy-mm-dd_username.txt

  $ git commit -am 'Sewing seeds' yyyy-mm-dd_username.txt
  [master 3f9e302] Sewing seeds
    1 file changed, 398 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 yyyy-mm-dd_username.txt

Now let's propose our diff upstream using the git object id of our last commit, ``3f9e302``.

::

  $ rad diff propose 3f9e302
  Proposing <DIFF-ID> to <PROJECT-ID>

If we want to see the status of our diff we can do that with:

::

  $ rad diff list
  (pending) [<MY-NAME>] 3f9e302 - Super dope contribution | <DIFF-ID>

As long as our garden is the correct dimensions, it shouldn't take long for our proposed diff to be accepted and then we'll be able to see our garden on the map at https://radicle.xyz/garden.
