===========================
Tutorial 2: Maintainer
===========================

*Part 2 of this tutorial walks through how to setup a project as a Maintainer. We'll use the Radicle Garden project again as an example, however, this time you'll need to find a friend to play the contributor role if want to see the entire workflow in action.*


Creating the Radicle Garden & managing contributions
====================================================

Now that we've shown off our green thumb, let's see what happens on the other side of the collaboration by seeing how the Radicle Garden project was created and how to manage contributions as a maintainer.

First we need to create the Radicle project. To do that we'll run ``$ rad project init``
and choose a project name. Note that the project is create in your current
working directory.

::

  $ mkdir acme && cd acme
  $ rad project init
  ? What's the name of your project (Default: acme)? acme
  ? Briefly describe your project? This is my description
  ? What kind of repository would you like to use?
  1. New peer-to-peer repository (git-ipfs **EXPERIMENTAL**)
  2. Add your own remote (e.g.: github / gitlab / ...)
      (see www.radicle.xyz/docs/#git-integration for more info)

We're going to choose option 1 to crate a P2P repo that's distributed with IPFS. When we do, we'll see the following:

::

  => Assembled rad-issue machine
  => Assembled rad-patch machine
  => project id: 12D3KooW...
  => adding "origin" remote: ipfs://ipns/12D3KooW...
  [master (root-commit) e3f2a9a] Radicle Setup
  Resolving IPNS name 12D3KooW...
  Pushed 1 objects
  Updating IPNS link 12D3KooW... to /ipfs/12D3KooW...
  To ipfs://ipns/12D3KooW...
  * [new branch]      master -> master
  Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
  => project created!

Now we're setup with everything we need to collaborate: a git repo, issues, and proposals.

If we'd like to invite others to contribute, we'll need to give them our project-id, which we can see with:

::

  $ rad project show-id
  => 12D3KooW...
  => Share this project id for people to collaborate with you on your project.

Let's say a collaborator already proposed a patch, using the steps outlined in the first section of this guide. We can see a list of all proposed patches, as well as the status of each patch, with ``$ rad patch list``.

::

  $ rad patch list
  state     patch #  commit                               author     updated
  pending   2        Make documentation more accessible   jane doe   2019-01-25 13:27

Then we can inspect the patch with:

::

  $ rad patch show <PATCH-NUMBER>
  accepted 0 Sewing seeds jane doe 2019-03-04T16:49:28Z

  From b118c572a441a774d4577ccb68f67fcfacc58df2 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
  From: jane doe <jane@doe.xyz>
  Date: Mon, 4 Mar 2019 17:47:15 +0100
  Subject: [PATCH] Sewing seeds

  ---
  mygarden.txt | 8 ++++++++
  ...

Maybe we'd like to add a comment to request additional changes:

::

  $ rad patch comment <PATCH-NUMBER> "Nice feature, but here is my comment..."
  Added comment to Patch <PATCH-NUMBER>

And then we can either reject the proposal:

::

  $ rad patch reject <PATCH-NUMBER>
  Patch <PATCH-NUMBER> has been rejected

or accept it:

::

  $ rad patch accept <PATCH-NUMBER>
  Merging proposal <PATCH-NUMBER> with master

Let's check the proposal status one more time to confirm:

::

  $ rad patch list
  state     patch #  commit        author    updated
  accepted  2       Sewing seeds  jane doe  2019-01-25 13:27

That's it!
