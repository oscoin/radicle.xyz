        Radicle works without a centralized server. No hassle with setting up
        your own hosting, and no need to trust companies with your data.

      <h2>Terminal-first</h2>
      <p>
        A Radicle project contains a git repository as well as the all the
        issues and proposals associated with that repo. All accessible from
        your terminal.

        Ever wanted fine-grained control over your code collaboration service?
        With Radicle you each unit of functionality&ndash;a <em>machine</em>&ndash;is its
        own litte P2P program, written in the Radicle language. You can change
        them to suit your needs, or create entirely new ones. Resources for
        developing your own Radicle machines coming soon!

      <h1>Radicle Stack</h1>
      <p>
        Each Radicle app is a peer-to-peer program that syncs with anyone
        who checks out your open source project.
        <br /><br />
        Taking inspiration from the original git model, where a single
        repo maintainer accepts patches, our Radicle alpha apps are administered
        by the project owner -- updates can be submitted by any
        peer on the Radicle network.
        <br /><br />
        In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about the Radicle technical stack
        and releasing documentation that will allow you
        to write your own apps using the same peer-to-peer
        infrastructure.
